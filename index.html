    <header>Breaking News: Compulsory Education for Pets Act Passed</header>
    <div class="content">
        <h2>New Law Mandates Education for Pets</h2>
        <p><strong>April 1, 2025 –</strong> In a groundbreaking move, lawmakers have passed the Compulsory Education for Domestic Animals Act (CEDAA), requiring structured training for pets based on recent scientific findings.</p>
        <p>Following extensive research proving that domestic animals—especially dogs, cats, and some bird species—possess cognitive abilities comparable to young children, the government has introduced a revolutionary law mandating formal education for pets.</p>
        <h3>What Does This Mean for Pet Owners?</h3>
         <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Koirina/pet-education-news/main/cat2.JPG" alt="Pets in a classroom" width="300">
        <p>Starting July 1, 2025, pet owners will be required to enroll their pets in structured training programs. The curriculum will focus on fundamental skills such as communication, problem-solving, and basic obedience, ensuring that pets contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mandatory training programs for pets from six months old</li>
            <li>Subsidies available for pet education</li>
            <li>Failure to comply may result in fines or mandatory enrollment</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Expert Opinions</h3>
        <p>Dr. Felicity Pawson, a leading animal cognition researcher, supports the initiative: "Studies confirm that pets are capable of understanding complex instructions and emotions. Formal education will not only improve their well-being but also strengthen the human-animal bond."</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, critics argue that the law is unrealistic. "Who's going to teach my cat? She barely listens to me as it is!" said one concerned pet owner.</p>
